description: Fat marker sketch - draw very low-fidelity UI concepts as hand-drawn images, several variants side by side. Use when the user wants to explore UI or UX directions for a problem quickly, before wireframes or prototypes, or asks for a rough sketch of a screen, component, or flow.

# Fat Marker Sketch

A **fat marker sketch** is a UI concept drawn “with such broad strokes that adding detail is difficult or impossible” ([Shape Up, ch. 4](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04)). The thick line keeps detail loose while making an idea visible, so the user can compare directions and pick one in minutes.

The **elements** are the output; the drawing only makes them visible. There are three kinds:

1. **Places**: what can be displayed or navigated to: screens, panels, dialogs, drop-down menus…
2. **Affordances**: what the user can act on or read: buttons, links, form fields, checkboxes, tooltips, labels.
3. **Arrows**: how the affordances take the user from place to place.

Leave out colors, copy, spacing, icons, and exact sizes. A labeled box is a finished affordance.

## 1. Frame the sketch

Fix what you are sketching (one screen, component, or flow) and the problem it solves, from the request. Default to **3 variants**, or the number the user asked for. Each variant is a genuinely different direction, not the same layout with a detail moved.

Done when you can state the problem in one sentence and name each variant in a few words.

## 2. Write the elements

For each variant, list its places, affordances, and arrows in text, using short place names for the `place` values in the JSON you render in step 3. Two examples:

```text
A · Map with side panel
- place: a map zoomed in on a country
- affordance: a dot for each point of interest, no clusters
- place: a panel showing a grid of postcards from that point of interest
- arrow: clicking a dot opens the panel

B · Collapsible page tree
- place: the list of top-level pages
- affordance: a search field above the pages
- affordance: a chevron before each page, pointing right when its subpages are hidden, down when they are visible
- arrow: clicking the chevron toggles the subpages
```

Done when every variant accounts for all three kinds, and every arrow starts from an affordance and ends in a place.

## 3. Draw

Draw all variants side by side in one image, left to right, each under its name, with a thick, hand-drawn line. Use the tool the user names, when they name one. Otherwise, use `@camille-hdl/fat-marker` first: write a one-line JSON file such as `{"variants":[{"variant":"A · Search","contains":[{"place":"Search","contains":[{"affordance":"Search"}]}]}]}`, then run `npx @camille-hdl/fat-marker sketch.json -o sketch.png`. If that package is unavailable or unsuitable, use any other tool available to you that produces an image. See the [package README](https://github.com/camille-hdl/fat-marker#readme) for the format and CLI, or run `npx @camille-hdl/fat-marker --help` for the complete format guide and example. When no tool fits, ask the user.

Done when the image file exists.

## 4. Check the image

Look at the image yourself before showing it: overlaps, clipped text, and arrows that miss their target show only there. Fix the drawing and check again. If you cannot view the image, say so when you show it.

Done when each element from step 2 is visible and readable in its variant.

## 5. Show and iterate

Give the user the image path, and the editable source if the tool produced one. Summarize each variant in one line.

When the user picks a direction, sketch variants of that direction, or of the next element it leads to, with the same steps.

Done when the user has picked a direction or asked for other variants.
