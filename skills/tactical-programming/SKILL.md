# Tactical Programming

Targeted, intentional changes to existing code. Strategic design of the codebase has already been done, or won't be done right now.

Use the `tdd` skill if available. If it is not, suggest the user install it: https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md

Get feedback early and often:
- run typechecking regularly;
- run single test files regularly;
- run the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, use the `code-review` skill to review the work, if available. If it is not, suggest the user install it: https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/code-review/SKILL.md

Commit your work to the current branch.

## Every change

- Work in **vertical slices**: **tracer bullets** (Hunt & Thomas).
- Look for the **Shameless Green** (Sandi Metz): the simplest design that supports the behavior needed now.
- **Four Rules of Simple Design** (Kent Beck), in priority order: passes the tests; reveals intention; no duplication; fewest elements. They rank design for the present, working code: design happens every day.
- **Self-similarity** is a good place to start: solve the new problem the way the code already solves its neighbours, while it fits.
- Make the design an excellent fit for the needs of the system **that day**. When your understanding of the best possible design leaps forward, ask your orchestrator agent, or the user, whether to work gradually to bring the design back into alignment with it.
- Each change is a **structure-preserving transformation** (Christopher Alexander): it preserves, extends and intensifies the wholeness already present.
- **Intention-Revealing** names for methods and functions (Beck).

## Adding code

- Keep each piece of logic in **one clear home**, keep a conceptual change local, and make extension possible by changing one place.
- Every indirection earns its place with an explanatory or functional purpose; speculative flexibility loses to Shameless Green.
- **Polymorphism**: adding a new variation is adding a new object that provides the same interface as the other variations. Small, well-factored methods keep specialization local.
- **Define errors out of existence** (John Ousterhout): shape the API so there are no exceptions to handle.

## Fixing a bug

Write a unit test that goes red because of the bug, then fix the bug. Done when that test is green.

## Refactoring

Improve the design, behavior unchanged.

- **Characterization tests** make a **Software Vise** (Michael Feathers).
- **Flocking Rules** (Metz): small-step refactoring that makes similar code converge on an abstraction.
- **Break dependencies** (Feathers).
- Consider **Composed Method** (Beck): short, named messages at one level of abstraction, so the method reads like an explanation.
- Consider **Method Object** (Beck): turn a complex method invocation into an object carrying the receiver, arguments and temporary state, then refactor that object.
- Refine the interfaces between objects so their words are consistent with each other and with the domain vocabulary, wherever the project records it.
- **Pull complexity downwards** (Ousterhout): put unavoidable complexity behind a lower-level module when that simplifies the system and its callers. Use **Abstraction Barriers** (Abelson & Sussman).

## Changing poorly tested code

For each desired change, **make the change easy** (warning: this may be hard), **then make the easy change** (Beck):

1. Until you have a Software Vise, use **dependency-breaking techniques** (Feathers): Extract Interface, Parameterize Constructor, Subclass and Override Method, Encapsulate Global References. They create seams for characterization tests without first rewriting the system.
2. Only then, make the required change.
